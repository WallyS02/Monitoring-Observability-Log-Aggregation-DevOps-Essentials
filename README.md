# Monitoring-Observability-Log-Aggregation-DevOps-Essentials
## If I'll find any other feature to be useful - it'll surely be added!
## How it works?
Monitoring is a systematic collection and analysis of data \(e.g. metrics\) in real time to assess the health of infrastructure, applications and services. It's purpose is detection of occurring issues \(e.g. server crashes, CPU limit exceeded\) and rapid response. Example of Monitoring tool is Prometheus.

Observability is an ability to understand the state of a system based on its outputs: metrics, logs, and traces. It's purpose is complex debugging of systems and applications. Example of a tool linked to observability is Grafana - visualization tool that allows for correlating data.

Log Aggregation is a centralization and processing of logs from various sources \(servers, applications, containers\) in one place. It's purpose is improving analysis, search, and event correlation \(e.g. tracking transactions across microservices\). Example of Log Aggregation tool is Loki.
